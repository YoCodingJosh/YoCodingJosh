### Yo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh and I'm a pretty simple dude: I like writing code and watching anime.

I write code primarily using C#, JavaScript, C/C++, and Java.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  * A game using C# and FNA (using .NET 6!)
  * MyAnimeList stats/metrics app using Node.js with Express ([repo](https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/anime_stats))
    * kinda on the backburner
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  * iOS with SwiftUI
  * Angular
  * Ruby
    * and Rails
  * Japanese
  * Rust
