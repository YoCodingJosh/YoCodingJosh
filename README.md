### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh and I'm a simple dude: I like writing code and I like watching anime.

I write code primarily using C++, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  * MyAnimeList stats app using Node/Express
  * A game using C#/MonoGame or C++/SDL/OpenGL (haven't decided yet)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  * Rust
  * GraphQL
  * iOS app dev (Swift/Obj-C)
  * Japanese
