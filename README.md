### Yo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh, I'm a software engineer and consultant.

I write code primarily using C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++, Ruby, and Java.

I'm trying to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time.

  * An arkanoid-like game written in C++ using SDL2 for Windows, macOS, Linux, HTML5, and (hopefully) Nintendo Switch (and other consoles)
    * This will a higher-performance (Vulkan/DX12) and more featured port of: https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/brick-blaster
