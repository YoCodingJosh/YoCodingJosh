## Yo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh, and I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur. Nice to meet ya!

My day job is a Ruby on Rails Engineer at [WellSky](https://github.com/mediwareinc). My side gig is launching [HYPEWORKS](https://github.com/HYPEWORKS).

I write code primarily using TypeScript/JavaScript, C#, C/C++, Ruby, and Java.

I'm trying to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time.
