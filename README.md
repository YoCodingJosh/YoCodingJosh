### Yo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh, I'm a software engineer.

I write code primarily using C#, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, and Java.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  * A social network, [@oshiete](https://github.com/oshiete), using Node.js, ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL, and more.
    * suffering a little bit of analysis paralysis over how to architect it lol
  * A small/simple arkanoid-like game using Vue.js with TypeScript: https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/brick-blaster
    * And a C++ port
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  * Ruby/Rails
  * Japanese
