### Hey hey! 👋

I'm Josh and I'm a simple dude: I like writing code and I like watching anime.

I write code primarily using C++, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Python.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  * MyAnimeList stats app using Node/Express
    * Along with refactoring its frontend to use Angular instead of jQuery 😂
  * A game using C#/MonoGame or C++/SDL/OpenGL (haven't decided yet)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  * Angular with TypeScript
  * iOS with Swift
  * AWS
  * Japanese
  * Rust
