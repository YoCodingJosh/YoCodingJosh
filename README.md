### Hey hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh and I'm a simple dude: I like writing code and watching anime.

I work at [@ArtisanTechGroup](https://github.com/ArtisanTechGroup) as a software engineering consultant.

I write code primarily using C++, JavaScript, C#, and Java.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  * MyAnimeList stats/metrics app using Node.js with Express ([repo](https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/anime_stats))
  * A game using C++ with SDL2
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  * iOS with Swift
  * Japanese
  * Rust
