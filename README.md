### Yo! 👋

I'm Josh, I'm a software engineer.

I write code primarily using C#, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, and Java.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  * A social network, [@oshiete](https://github.com/oshiete), using Node.js, Passport.js, PostgreSQL, and more.
  * A small/simple arkanoid-like game using Vue.js with TypeScript: https://github.com/YoCodingJosh/brick-blaster
    * And a more featured C++ port using SDL2 for Windows, Mac, Linux, HTML5, and (hopefully) Nintendo Switch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  * Ruby/Rails
  * Japanese
