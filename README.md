### Hey hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh and I'm a simple dude: I like writing code and watching anime.

I work at [@ArtisanTechGroup](https://github.com/ArtisanTechGroup) as a software engineering consultant.

I write code primarily using C++, JavaScript, C#, and Java.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  * MyAnimeList stats app using Node/Express
    * Along with refactoring its frontend to use a more modern framework rather than jQuery ðŸ˜‚
  * A game using C#/MonoGame or C++/SDL/OpenGL (haven't decided yet)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  * Angular with TypeScript
  * iOS with Swift
  * Japanese
  * Rust
