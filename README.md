## Yo! 👋

I'm Josh, I'm a software engineer and consultant.

I write code primarily using JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, C/C++, Ruby, Rust, and Java.

I'm trying to make the world a better place, one line of code at a time.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  * A social network, [@oshiete](https://github.com/oshiete), using Ruby on Rails
  * Several game concepts. Some using C++ with SDL2 and some using C# using FNA.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  * Ruby and Rails
  * Rust
  * 日本語
